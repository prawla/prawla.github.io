                <p class="bodytext_process">In this process, the ink is pushed through a mesh or stencil to print a particular design on the desired material. Either by cutouts or by an impermeable material, the liquid only transfers to the areas the screen permits. Only one colour can be applied at a time so a screen must be made for each. </p>
                <p class="bodytext_process">Formats compatible with this technique include PSD, .JPEG, .TIFF, .PNG, .GIF and .BMP. Keep in mind that if files are not saved at 300 d.p.i. quality then thereâ€™s no guarantee that the final product will look as good as it can. </p>
                <p class="bodytext_process">Even though they share some basic components, inks for screen printing are different from those of other processes. The most notable thing about them is that they are thicker and more viscous than other inks.</p>
